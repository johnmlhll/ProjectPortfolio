            A hearty welcome to my software portfolio application built on ASP.NET Core MVC @ViewData["Version"] on @ViewData["Runtime"] running

        <h2>The Software Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
            Although, I started to code in September 2014 for the first time in earnest, the Software Development set out below is based 
			upon completed projects of note from September 2016 when I started the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing 
			(Software Development) at <a href="http://www.dbs.ie/courses/ict-skills-programme" target="_blank">Dublin Business School</a>. 
			Selected projects completed on the course along with those of note completed in my spare time; both then and since make up the 
			bulk of my software portfolio. Please note certain Projects on my Github profile that predate the portfolio start date of 
			September 2016 will not be included in my software portfolio. I have implemented a JavaScript toggle function to make
			purusal of my software portfolio more user friendly, so just click on any of the "Show More/Less" buttons under the 
			project entries to see the details associated with the entry.

    				is written on a ASP.NET stack in C sharp with a native XML database for contact us information along with SQL server for 
    				customer and transactional information. The relational Database instance is designed and developed to 3rd normal form
                    ensuring good quality data persistence for core data generated by the site. The front end is crafted using Razor, 
    				HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. The purpose is to give you a good overview of John's technical and design ability in a 
    				prior designed and built application, which he re-engineered to a smaller cost footprint yet maintaining data retention to 
                    a good standard for deployment on Azure.

                    This project is build on an Angular4 framework as a web application front end. The use of Bootstrap and any other
					framework (e.g. ASP.NET) is purposely absent to show case the pure Angular 4 features using HTML5, CSS3, Typescript and the 
					Angular 4 framework! The frontend is basically a brochure style web application 
					that gives tips on visiting Dublin, Ireland along with giving tips on Angular 4 and its powerful front end 
					features in developing a web application!

                    This project is bascially a Java framework to house a proprietary video analysis algorithm belonging to 
					Kinesense Ltd. I was the Junior Software Engineer on the project charged with building the Java framework running 
					on Linux/CentOS virtual machine's in turn on Linux/CentOS servers with ARM 64 processors and a PostgreSQL databse solution. My job was then to 
					take the processing part of the prioriety video analysis algorithm in C# and transcode it into Java ensuring
                    the framework imported video files, processed the frames and conducted a frame by frame analysis
					storing data generated by the algorithm into the database solution within the framework. As I am bound by a Non
					Disclosure Agreement, no more information can be disclosed on this project. That said, I did gain a good proficiency in Java,
					Database Design and Development in PostgreSQL along with trouble shooting development issues in a commercial environment.

					on the desktop (i.e. fat client) for data entry of personal details. The application is connected to a MySQL database normalised
					to 3rd normal form and accepts (personal) data inputs for storage by the database.
